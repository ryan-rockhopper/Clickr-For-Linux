# Clickr AppImages
Thank you for navigating to this page! This is an alternative place to download the necessary AppImages for the Clickr project. The reason for this repository is to avoid logistical issues with Cloudflare hosting our files. 

## Website
You can navigate to our website to learn more about the project. www.keyclickr.com

## Code
Clickr is FOSS (free and open source software). For those who are curious, check out the codebase here: https://capstone.cs.utah.edu/clickr or here https://github.com/clickrTeam

### Instructions
The AppImages here are for Linux only. They have been tested to work on Ubuntu and MXLinux.
1. Clone the repo
2. Extract clickr.tar.gz with the following command: `tar -xvf clickr.tar.gz`
3. Make the setup script executable with the following command: `chmod +x setup.sh`
4. Run the setup script: `./setup.sh`
5. Start the keybinder by running the following command: `keybinder`
6. In another terminal window, start the Clickr app: `clickr`
7. You are ready to start customizing your keyboard experience! As a tip, you only need to use the Clickr app when setting up your profile. Once it is configured how you like it, you can close the Clickr app and the Keybinder will rebind your keys in the background. You can pause the Keybinder using the tray icon.
